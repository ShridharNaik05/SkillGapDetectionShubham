Problem Statement
Many students and job seekers are unaware of the specific skills required for different job roles. This lack of clarity creates a skill gap between candidate capabilities and industry expectations, resulting in poor employment readiness and inefficient upskilling efforts.

Solution Overview
This project provides a prototype system that analyzes a candidate’s existing skills (through manual input or resume-based data) and compares them with job-role-specific skill requirements. The system identifies missing skills (skill gaps) and presents insights that help candidates understand their employment readiness and areas for improvement.
